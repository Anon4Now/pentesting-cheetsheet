# Lateral Movement

The goal here is to move within the entire network. After all, the main goal is not only to successfully exploit a publicly available system but also to get sensitive data or find all ways that an attacker could render the network unusable. One of the most common examples is ransomware. If a system in the corporate network is infected with ransomware, it can spread across the entire network. It locks down all the systems using various encryption methods, making them unusable for the whole company until a decryption key is entered.
In this stage, see how far movement in the entire network is possible and what vulnerabilities can be found from the internal perspective that might be exploited. To do so, run through several phases:

1. Pivoting
2. Evasive Testing
3. Information Gathering
4. Vulnerability Assessment
5. (Privilege) Exploitation
6. Post-Exploitation
