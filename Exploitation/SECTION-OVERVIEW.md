# Exploitation

During the Exploitation stage, look for ways that these weaknesses can be adapted to the use case to obtain the desired role (i.e., a foothold, escalated privileges, etc.). If a reverse shell is desired, modify the PoC to execute the code, so the target system connects back to attacker host over (ideally) an encrypted connection to an IP address we specify. Therefore, the preparation of an exploit is mainly part of the Exploitation stage.
