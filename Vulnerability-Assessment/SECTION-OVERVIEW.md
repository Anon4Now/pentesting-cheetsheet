# Vulnerability Assessment

During the vulnerability assessment phase, examine and analyze the information gathered during the information gathering phase. The vulnerability assessment phase is an analytical process based on the findings. This should focus on identifying flaws, bugs, or other issues with the systems/tech being employed. A priority should be applied to exploits with working POC's for fast access.
